# Intel CPU with intel_pstate driver in passive mode ('intel_cpufreq') or

#   Governors marked (*) above are power efficient for *almost all* workloads

# Set CPU energy/performance policies EPP and EPB:

# Values are given in order of increasing power saving.
# Requires:
# * Intel CPU
#   EPP: Intel Core i 6th gen. or newer CPU with intel_pstate driver
#   EPB: Intel Core i 2nd gen. or newer CPU with intel_pstate driver
#     as of kernel 5.2; alternatively module msr and
#     x86_energy_perf_policy from linux-tools
#   EPP and EPB are mutually exclusive: when EPP is available, Intel CPUs
#   will not honor EPB. Only the matching feature will be applied by TLP.
# * AMD Zen 2 or newer CPU
#   EPP: amd-pstate driver in active mode ('amd-pstate-epp') as of kernel 6.3
# Default: balance_performance (AC), balance_power (BAT)

# (*) recommended.
# Separate values for multiple disks with spaces. Use the special value 'keep'
# to keep the kernel default scheduler for the particular disk.
# Notes:
# - Multi queue (blk-mq) may need kernel boot option 'scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1'
#   and 'modprobe mq-deadline-iosched|kyber|bfq' on kernels < 5.0
# - Single queue schedulers are legacy now and were removed together with
#   the old block layer in kernel 5.0
# Default: keep
# according to https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-56-nvme, 'none' scheudler gives best performance.

# Battery Care -- Charge thresholds
# Charging starts when the charger is connected and the charge level
# is below the start threshold. Charging stops when the charge level
# is above the stop threshold.
# Required hardware: Lenovo ThinkPads and select other laptop brands
# are driven via specific plugins
# - Active plugin and support status are shown by tlp-stat -b
# - Vendor specific threshold levels are shown by tlp-stat -b, some
#   laptops support only 1 (on)/ 0 (off) instead of a percentage level
# - When your hardware supports a start *and* a stop threshold, you must
#   specify both, otherwise TLP will refuse to apply the single threshold
# - When your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start
#   value to 0
# - Older ThinkPads may require an external kernel module, refer to the
#   output of tlp-stat -b
# For further explanation and vendor specific details refer to
